# Obsolete

The dev has now published an all-in-one image! Therefore, I'm cancelling the separate api/frontend addons and moving back to the original one. It now comprises both API and frontend, and exposes both on different ports.

As before, you can export your database, log to the new addon, then reimport it. Perhaps it could work straight out of the box as the data path stays the same
