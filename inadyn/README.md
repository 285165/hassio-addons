## About

[Inadyn](https://github.com/troglobit/inadyn), or In-a-Dyn, is a small and simple Dynamic DNS, DDNS, client with HTTPS support. Commonly available in many GNU/Linux distributions, used in off the shelf routers and Internet gateways to automate the task of keeping your Internet name in sync with your publicÂ¹ IP address. It can also be used in installations with redundant (backup) connections to the Internet.
